At present CWN is having three redundant high end carrier class core switches and one hundred access switches. The Connectivity between the core switch to the access switch is though multimode fiber optic backbone. The existing bandwidth of the intranet is 10 GBPS. Currently the CWN is supplemented with 1.5 GBPS of redundant internet link to cater to the internet requirement of the campus. The college has hosted a private cloud on virtualized environment of blade servers and flex servers with fiber SAN storage to meet the computing requirement of the campus.
