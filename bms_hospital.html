                    <h5>Basavanagudi,Bangalore<br>Diagnostic Center Hospital</h5><p>Six decades ago a man with a mission to educate people first private Engineering College. The man was none other than the founding father of BMS educational institution Sri B.M Sreenivasaiah. His son, Mr. B.S Narayan, pursued his father’s dream to help the needy and laid the foundation stone for B.S Narayan memorial hospital in the year 1991. Before his efforts could gain momentum his soul left us with the responsibility to carry forward his legacy and give the best affordable medical facility. Our life trustee Mrs. Ragini Narayan, kindled by the benevolent and noble thoughts of her husband, has turned B.S Narayan Memorial Day Care center into a state of the art multidimensional hospital, where anyone can seek cure and are under the guidance of experienced doctors without worrying about the cost.</p>
