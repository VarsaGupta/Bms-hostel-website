## Description

I had created this hostel website **"BMS INN"** as my college web dev project in my 3rd semester solely on my own. It took me a month to complete this project. Being a hostelite, this project is more like an emotion to me. This website is built in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.

## Motivation

Being a hostelite myself, I recognized the need for a hostel website to optimize our college experience. My website aims to simplify hostel life by providing a centralized platform for communication, information sharing, and accessing essential resources.
